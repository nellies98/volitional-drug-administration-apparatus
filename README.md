# volitional-drug-administration-apparatus
Each Arduino component sits within a 3D printed case that attaches to a static cage top. This design allows for consumption in the home cage environment for singly housed mice. We utilized iterative design to hone the 3D printed parts; a full list of parts, their uses, and the 3D printing files can be found on the github page along with the code developed for this system
